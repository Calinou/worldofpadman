# Security Information

PadWorld Entertainment takes the security of World of PADMAN seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/PadWorld-Entertainment). If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of our repositories please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them directly to PadWorld Entertainment by sending an email to <team@worldofpadman.net>. We will response as soon as possible. If for some reason you do not receive a response, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English, as PadWorld Entertainment is basically an international team. However, a large part of the core team is German, so we also accept reports in German.

If it is not possible to communicate in English or German, then another language can be chosen. We will then use available translator tools, but they can lead to a limitation in communication. We ask you to take this into account.

## Policy

PadWorld Entertainment follows the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).
