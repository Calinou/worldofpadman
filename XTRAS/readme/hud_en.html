			<b><u>Changeable HUDs</u></b>
			<br><br>
			We created 10 different HUD designs for you to choose from. Just select the one you want and the change will be applied immediately.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:220px;'>
			<b><u>'Left'</u></b>
			<br><br>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/hud/lefthud.jpg' alt=''>
			The left part of the HUD shows your selected weapon and the ammo for it. The scores of the teams are also shown here
			so you can see see which team is currently winning. The yellow circle containing the X shows which team is yours.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:160px;'>
			<b><u>'Center'</u></b>
			<br><br>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/hud/centerhud.jpg' alt=''>
			This is the most important part of the HUD. Here you can see your health and shield status.
			The left part (red) is for health, and when it's completely filled, you have 100% health.
			You can have more than 100% health with revival or after respawn. Having part of the bar a darker red shows this.
			The blue side (shield) on the right works in the same way. If you have more than 100% shield, the part over 100% is shown on the bar as dark blue.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:240px;'>
			<b><u>'Right'</u></b>
			<br><br>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/hud/righthudsyc.jpg' alt=''><img class='readme_image' style='float:right;' src='pictures/hud/righthudbb.jpg' alt=''>
			The design of this part depends on the game mode you are playing. In normal FFA, TDM and "Last Pad Standing", the right part is empty.
			Playing 'Spray your Color', 'Big Balloon' or 'Capture the Lolly', you'll find some helpful information here.

			<br><br>
			'Spray your Color': The amount of collected cartridges is displayed here. Having a limit of eight collected cartridges,
			you'll notice that eight small dots are here. Every red dot means one collected cartridge.
			<br><br>
			'Big Balloon': Shows which team dominates which balloons. After a few rounds, you'll know where to find the each balloon.
			A small bar shows how much longer you have to be near a balloon to activate it.
			<br><br>
			'Capture the Lolly': In this gametype you'll see the status of the Lollies here. There are three different states: the lolly is safe in your base, it is taken by an enemy, or
			the status is unknown, meaning that the Lolly is dropped somewhere in the map.
