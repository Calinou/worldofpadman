			<b><u>Bot Support</u></b>
			<br><br>
			The World of Padman features full bot support for all game types! All you offline gamers out there will be happy to play Spray your Color,
			Big Balloon, Last Pad Standing and Capture the Lolly with bots. The bots play very well, and most maps have been optimized for good bot play.
			It is pure fun to see the blue nosed people frag each other in SyC and BB.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><u>Drop Cardriges / Drop Lolly</u></b>
			<br><br>
			This features only works in Team SyC and Capture the Lolly! You have collected some cartridges, but your health is running out and you'll not reach the teleporter in time?
			You can to give a team mate some of your cartridges so that the teammate can get some extra points for the team with a spray killer (5) or spray god (8) medal. In Capture the Lolly you'll be
			able to throw the lolly to other players.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><u>Voice Chat</u></b>
			<br><br>
			In the past you had to use the keyboard to communicate with other players, but these days are gone, because World of Padman features voice chat. This has to be activated in the menu
			at Setup -> System -> Sound. After activating it, you also have the choice between automatic speech detection and 'push-to-talk' - like from old walkie-talkies. If you choose
			'push-to-talk', you can bind a key to this fuction in the Controls -> Misc menu.<br>
			Within a match, you can adjust the volume of the players or mute single players via an ingame menu.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><u>GlowSkins</u></b>
			<br><br>
			For serious tournaments it is important that you can recognize other players as enemies very fast. That's why you can activate so called GlowSkins in the menu ('Setup -> Game Options') in
			World of Padman. If you have turned them on, the models of the enemys will get a shiny green skin, which makes them stick them out of the surrounding environment. Especially for clans and
			fast-paced 1on1's is this option a blessing in disguise. For the game design, it is not. ;)
			</p>

			<b><u>The Server HUD</u></b>
			<br><br>
			<img style='float:left;' class='readme_image' alt='' src='pictures/misc/server_hud_kl.jpg'>
			Server info can be displayed in a small window you can toggle using a key of your choice (default=k). It will show you things like the point limit, time limit, etc.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><u>Warmup</u></b>
			<br><br>
			The command g_WarmupReady can be used to delay the starting of the game before a certain percentage of players are ready.
			The server admin can set g_WarmupReady to a value between 0 and 1 (first set "g_doWarmup 1"!) - 0 means no one has to type in /ready and
			the game starts immediately and 1 means that 100% of the players have to type it in. With this method, 0.6 means 60 percent have to type in /ready and so on.
			<br><br>
			Some examples for your cfg:
			<br><br>
			set g_doWarmup "1"<br>
			set g_WarmupReady "0.5" // 50 % have to be /ready
			<br><br>
			or
			<br><br>
			set g_doWarmup "1"
			set g_WarmupReady "0.8" // 80 % have to be /ready
			<br><br>
			This command is especially useful for LPS games, just after a map change. The other players can wait until the rest have successfully joined the server.
			For team play it is cool too, if you do not want to just have fun, but have a serious game (clan war or something like this).
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><u>Chat Icons</u></b>
			<br><br>
			Everything is colorful, even the chat! The chat logos are colorful and show off a small pic of the model the chatter uses, making it easier to identify
			the chatters. You'll see there are four different chat methods: "only text" (normal and long) is a normal chat style and "+icons" (normal and long)
			is for the chat with the new icons. Normal and long stands for the time the chat text is displayed.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b><u>Bugs</u></b>
			<br><br>
			The game has been in development for years, but this does not mean that it is bug-free. Like every publisher and developer we have added some bugs
			to the game, so that you have something to look at. If you find one of these bugs then please E-Mail us and we'll work on a fix.
