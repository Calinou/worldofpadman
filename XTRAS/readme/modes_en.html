			<b><u>Spray your Color (SyC)</u></b>
			<br><br><img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/misc/teleporter.jpg' alt=''>

			Spray your Color (SyC) is the main game type in WoP. The goal is to spray your logo on the walls in the spray room. But, hey, that would be too easy:<br>
			You have to frag an opponent to get a cartridge, you need to collect this cartridge to spray a logo.
			The maximum number of cartridges you can have at any one time is eight. After you have at least one cartridge,
			you can enter a special teleporter (shown on the left), which will spawn you into a new room: the spray room. In here you have only your spray pistol,
			so no fragging in here. ;) In the spray room are two different walls: one for the red team and one for the blue team.
			You only get points if you spray your logo on the wall of your team; otherwise you just lose the cartridge(s) without scoring.
			This game type is playable as FFA and Team Play. In FFA there is no difference between the walls, just spray your logo where you want.
			In FFA you cannot collect your own cartridge but in Team Play you may remove your color cartridge by walking over it.
			<br><br>
			Scoring:<br>
			Every logo sprayed gives your team 5 points. In FFA you will score only for yourself ;).If you manage to spray five logos without leaving the spray room,
			you'll receive 10 bonus points. For eight logos without leaving you'll gain an additional bonus of 25 points.<br>
			<br>
			Examples:<br>
			3 logos: 3 * 5 points = 15 points<br>
			5 logos: 6 * 5 points = 30 points + 10 points bonus = 40 points<br>
			8 logos: 8 * 5 points = 40 points + 10 points bonus + 25 points bonus = 75 points

			<b><u>Big Balloon (BB)</u></b>
			<br><img class='readme_image' style='float:right;' src='pictures/misc/balloon.jpg' alt=''>
			<br>
			Big Balloon is nothing more than the good old 'Domination' known from the game Unreal Tournament. The only difference is, that we use boxes that contain balloons. For all those who don't
			know what 'Domination' is about here's a short description:<br>
			In every map you will find three boxes. As soon as you touch a box, a balloon of your team's color will float up. To fasten the process of raising the balloon, simply get more players of
			your team aside.
			As long as the balloon is fully up you'll get points! But if the opponent touches the box for more than 3 seconds,
			your balloon will be destroyed and a new one with the color of the opposing team will come out. Now the opposing team gets the points
			if a successful re-capture is made!<br>
			To make it easier to locate the balloons in the maps, we have implanted a special HUD and a 'wall-hack', that also indicates the color of the balloon, so which team scores at the moment.
			<br><br>
			Scoring:<br>
			For every balloon in your team's color your team will get 1 point every 2 seconds.<br>
			If your team dominates all three balloons, the points are doubled. Every two seconds you'll get two points for one balloon so in total you will get 6 points per 2 seconds!

			<b><u>Capture the Lolly (CtL)</u></b>
			<br><img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/misc/lollies.jpg' alt=''>
			<br>
			The well known and liked gametype 'Capture the Flag' has its appearance in the World of PADMAN, too. Instead of flags, the Pad is hunting sweet lollies. This mode is played by two teams,
			each trying to get into the enemy's base to steal the lolly. After taking the lolly, you have to reach your own base and get to your lolly to score. If your team's lolly is stolen by the 
			enemy, the lolly has to be returned before you can score. Returning the lolly is done by fragging the enemy holding the lolly and running over the remaining candy. It will instantly return 
			to your base and doesn't have to be carried back. Only teams which work together well will be successful.
			</p>

			<b><u>Last Pad Standing (LPS)</u></b>
			<br><img class='readme_image' style='float:right;' src='pictures/misc/lpswallhack.jpg' alt=''>
			<br>
			LPS is our Last Man Standing game type. Every player has a fixed number of lives and will go into spectator mode as soon as all his/her lives are gone.
			At the end of the game there will be only one player still alive. He/she is the winner!
			Oh, you will notice that we have implemented a 'wall-hack' so that you can locate all of your opponents fairly easily. This was done because of all the campers who like to play
			hide and seek to keep their lives up. Sorry campers, no chance. And to make it a bit more exciting, the leading player is marked with a red symbol, so the other players will hunt that player
			for sure. If more than one player is on top of the lives list, they will all be marked with the red icon.

			<b><u>InstaPad</u></b>
			<br><img class='readme_image' style='float:right;' src='pictures/weapons/injector.jpg' alt=''>
			<br>
			'InstaPad' isn't a standalone game type, it can be additionally activated to every game type in the game from the menu. If you play with 'InstaPad' activated, all weapons and ammo boxes will
			be removed from the maps and the players will be equiped with unlimmited ammo and a special weapon from the beginning - the iNJECTOR. The iNJECTOR has basically the same characteristics as the
			SPLASHER, so it has a low fire rate, but causes high damage - one hit usually crushes the enemy down. This weapon is accessorily featured with a special zoom which highlights the enemies.
			Hence 'InstaPad' is the perfect addon for fans of sharp shooters and fast gameplay.
