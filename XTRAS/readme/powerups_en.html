			<b><u>Health</u></b>
			<br><br>

			<p style='min-height:220px;'>
			<b>Loading Station</b>
			<br><br>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/misc/health.jpg' alt=''>
			In the "World of PADMAN" there are no health bubbles to collect. Instead of picking health up, you have to step on a "Heath Station".
			As long as you stand on a loading station you'll regenerate your health. Naturally, you'll not get more than 100% health.
			If you reach the 100% a voice will let you know that you are fully regenerated. Also, the stations do not have unlimited health to give.
			The size of the cross shows you how much health is left at a station. If a station is empty, it will regenerate itself, this will take one minute,
			then it is ready to use again.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:175px;'>
			<b>PadShield</b>
			<br><br>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/shield.jpg' alt=''>
			Collect this item and you'll instantly get 100% shield!
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:175px;'>
			<b>PadShard</b>
			<br><br>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/shard.jpg' alt=''>
			Collect a PadShard and you'll receive 5 shield points. The nice thing about the shards is, that you'll get 5 points even if you already have 100% shield!
			</p>

			<b><u>Power-ups</u></b>
			<br><br>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/padpower.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>PADPOWER</b>
			<br><br>
			This gives a mixture of power and protection. Picking up this power-up means that you need to hurry up with your fragging.
			You will do more than 2 times the normal damage and you will also protected by damage from your opponents! And as an extra, you own weapons don't hurt you either (try jumps with the Imperius 
			or Betty).
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/revival.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>REViVAL</b>
			<br><br>
			You'll not be totally un-killable, but your health will regenerate automatically. With this item you'll get up to 200% health.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/jumper.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>JUMPER</b>
			<br><br>
			Jump around. This power-up lets you jump three times higher than normal. You can reach parts of the maps that you would not normally see.
			Jumping around also makes you a target that is hard to hit, although watch out for those snipers.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/visionless.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>ViSiONLESS</b>
			<br><br>
			It's cool to hunt people down while being invisible, but you are not 100% invisible. A slightly visual effect can be seen of you look carefully, but most of the time you'll be able to reach
			the teleporter or steal the lolly without being seen and attacked by the opponents.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/speedy.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>SPEEDY</b>
			<br><br>
			Hey, how fast can you get?! The Speedy power-up will increase your speed a lot and that's not only good to hunt your opponents with the Punchy, it also helps you escape.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:200px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/puppetmaster.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>Puppet Master</b>
			<br><br>
			After 5 frags with Punchy you will become the Puppet Master of World of PADMAN for 30 seconds.
			You'll be faster and stronger than your opponents, and the Punchy will cause even more damage. Hunt your enemies and bite them!
			</p>

			<b><u>Holdables</u></b>
			<br><br>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/floater.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>FLOATER</b>
			<br><br>
			The FLOATER lets you fly. The cool thing is that you decide when you want to fly and how long you want to do so.
			After you have picked up this item you'll get a new display on the right, showing how much "fuel" is still left.
			Pressing the "USE" key will give you a boost up into the air.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/killerducks.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>KiLLERDUCKS</b>
			<br><br>
			You can let these bad beasts loose on your opponents. As soon as you are close to them, you can send out a duck by pressing the "USE" key.
			The ducks will now automatically search for an opponent that is near them, and will attack and follow him. But if there is no opponent,
			the ducks could attack you!
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/boomies.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>BOOMiES</b><br><br>
			"Small, but powerful", that's how these mines are described best. Whenever the player picks up the item, three limpet mines that can be placed around the map are added to the player's
			inventory. You won't be able to create whole mine fields with that, but the mines work very well as a defensive weapon. After having been placed by the 'USE' button, they explode when
			approached and deal massive damage. Because of their dangerousness there are locations on the map where the mines must not be placed.<br>
			<i>This power-up is only available in the modes 'Capture the Lolly' and 'BigBalloon'.</i>
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:165px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/powerups/bambam.jpg' alt=''>
			<b>BAMBAM</b><br><br>
			The BAMBAM is a turret that automatically shoots any target in sight. It can be disabled by sufficient fire power though. Because the BAMBAM is a mighty weapon, it must not be placed on
			certain areas on the map as well as in hard to reach places. The BAMBAM is set up with the 'USE' button.<br>
			<i>This power-up is only available in the mode 'Capture the Lolly'.</i>
