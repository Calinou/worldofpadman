			<b><u>PUNCHY</u></b>
			<br><br>
			This puppet is really dangerous for your opponents. It's bite causes high damage! This weapon is the right choice for close combat,
			or when you want to escape a senseless fight, because while using the Punchy you can run a bit faster than with the other weapons-
			good to get away, or get closer to your enemies. If you make 5 frags with punchy in one round, you'll become a Puppet Master (see Power-ups).
			</p>

			<b><u>NiPPER</u></b>
			<br><br>
			The NiPPER is the starting weapon and works in the same way as a pistol. This weapon has an auto-fire like every other weapon,
			but if you click your mouse button really fast, it will shoot faster than the normal auto-fire.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:130px;'>

			<b><u>PUMPER</u></b>
			<br><br>
			The PUMPER is like a shotgun. Having flashes at the end of the trail, it lets you hurt people near the trail. This weapon has a limited firing range.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:130px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/weapons/bubbleg.jpg' alt=''>
			<b><u>BUBBLE G.</u></b>
			<br><br>
			It's gettin' colorful. The BUBBLE G. (Bubble Gum) shoots small little colored balls very fast. These might make you go crazy ;).
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:130px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/weapons/balloony.jpg' alt=''>
			<b><u>BALLOONY</u></b>
			<br><br>
			This is a fun weapon. It shoots cool water bombs, which jump around in the arena. It's not easy to make an aimed shot,
			but if you hit the opponent, he'll take a lot of damage. The perfect weapon to shoot into a crowd!
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:130px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/weapons/splasher.jpg' alt=''>
			<b><u>SPLASHER</u></b>
			<br><br>
			Every game needs a sniper rifle. In the World of PADMAN, the SPLASHER is the weapon for all the campers out there. With its variable zoom,
			it is the perfect weapon for long and mid-range distances. Disadvantage: it needs some time to reload.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:130px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/weapons/boaster.jpg' alt=''>
			<b><u>BOASTER</u></b>
			<br><br>
			This is a really strange weapon. Its jet, curved like a water jet, causes a lot of damage. Besides the damage, the jet will make the floor very slippery.
			It is not easy to move on this floor, so you will be an easy target if you walk on it.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:130px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/weapons/betty.jpg' alt=''>
			<b><u>BOOM-BOOM BETTY</u></b><br><br>The BETTY shoots really huge fire balls. Important: the fire balls do not fly very fast but they
			do cause splash damage over a large area. It's really good for mid-ranged distances.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:130px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/weapons/imperius.jpg' alt=''>
			<b><u>iMPERiUS</u></b>
			<br><br>
			If you see a pink star, then RUN! With its all-destroying explosion, the iMPERiUS is the most powerful weapon ever.
			But this gun has two big disadvantages. The maximum ammo limit is set at two shots, and you have to hold down the fire key for a few seconds
			until the weapon is ready to shoot. But do not hold it down too long or the weapon will explode in your hands.
			Oh, and it shakes while loading, so it's not very easy to aim.
			</p>

			<p style='min-height:130px;'>
			<img class='readme_image' style='float:left;' src='pictures/weapons/injector.jpg' alt=''>
			<b><u>iNJECTOR</u></b>
			<br><br>
			A very special weapon, so special, that you will not see it lying around in the maps. The iNJECTOR is only available in the 'InstaPad' game mode, but here it is the only weapon. The
			characteristic of this gun is basically the same as the SPLASHER ones, so it has a low fire rate, but causes very high damage. The Zoom of the iNJECTOR is an advanced one, because enemys are
			shown glowing, making them easy to track.
